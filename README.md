1. Install PostgreSQL: If you haven't already, you need to install PostgreSQL on your system. You can download it from the official PostgreSQL website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
 2. Install PostgreSQL Driver for Go: You need to install a PostgreSQL driver for Go. The pq package is a popular choice. You can install it using go get:
go get github.com/lib/pq (http://github.com/lib/pq)

 3. Import the Required Packages: In your Go code, import the necessary packages:
import (    "database/sql"    _ "github.com/lib/pq")
The _ "github.com/lib/pq" line is important because it registers the PostgreSQL driver with the database/sql package.
 4. Establish a Connection: Connect to your PostgreSQL database using sql.Open:

db, err := sql.Open("postgres", "postgres://user:password@localhost/dbname?sslmode=disable")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
defer db.Close()
Replace "user", "password", "localhost", and "dbname" with your PostgreSQL username, password, host, and database name respectively. The sslmode=disable parameter disables SSL for local connections. Make sure to handle errors appropriately.
